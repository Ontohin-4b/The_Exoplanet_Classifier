  
# The Exoplanet Classifier ü™ê
  
A simple yet effective web-based Machine Learning tool that predicts whether a given set of transit data corresponds to a genuine exoplanet, a false positive, or an unclassified candidate. We combined sheer ML performance with a clean and gorgeous frontend UI that lets users explore exoplanets without any technical expertise.

## Project Overview

NASA's various exoplanet survey missions have identified thousands of transit data points through **the transit method**. After extensive research, these data points are further classified into confirmed planets, false positives or planetary candidate. The data from this missions are open source and provided by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). **Our objective** was to create an AI model trained on these data which can help scientists to conduct preliminary prediction on the data to find out it's possibilities.


The ML model serves as a website which is developed with proper frontend, backend and Flask web framework to act as the bridge. Users have to provide some transit data as input and then the model will predict it's class. The intuitive UI is extremely helpful for those who doesn't have deep understanding of tech.

## Getting Started

  

  

1.  **Clone the repository**

  

```bash

  

git  clone  https://github.com/Ontohin-4b/The_Exoplanet_Classifier/

  

cd  "The_Exoplanet_Classifier"

  

```

  

  

2.  **Install dependencies**

  

```bash

  

pip  install  -r  requirements.txt

  

```

  

  

3.  **Train the model (only once)**

  

```bash

  

python  model/rfc_fit.py

  

```

  

  

1.  **Run the Flask framework**

  

  

```bash

  

python  app.py

  

```

  

  

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web interface.

  

  

6. If you want to close the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where you have run `app.py` from.

## Model Details

  

  

-  **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier

  

-  **Number of decision trees (`n_estimators`):** 1000

  

-  **Tree Depth:** None

  

-  **Training Datasets:** [Kepler Objects of Interest](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative), [K2 Planets and Candidates](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=k2pandc)

  

-  **Features:** 13 feature columns were used. Most of them are orbit and transit related features.

  

The model was trained to balance accuracy with generalization, ensuring predictions are reliable even for unseen candidates.
