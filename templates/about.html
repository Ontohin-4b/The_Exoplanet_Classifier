    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>
        The <b>Exoplanet Classifier‚Ñ¢</b> is a project developed by <b>Team Ontohin 4b</b>
        for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this web app is to predict new exoplanet‚Äôs status (<b>CONFIRMED</b>, <b>CANDIDATE</b>, <b>FALSE
            POSITIVE</b>) by evaluating user-given inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        User inputs are sent to our model through a Flask API endpoint.
        The model then predicts the class and returns a probability for each category.
        We built this using <b>scikit-learn‚Äôs LogisticRegression</b> with Softmax regression,
        which allows classification into more than two classes.
    </p>

    <h3>Possible Outputs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>CONFIRMED (2)</b> ‚Üí Represents a confirmed exoplanet.</li>
        <li><b>CANDIDATE (1)</b> ‚Üí Not confirmed or false positive; requires further analysis.</li>
        <li><b>FALSE POSITIVE (0)</b> ‚Üí Does not represent an exoplanet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Inputs</h2>
    <p>
        The model is trained on 14 features from NASA‚Äôs KOI dataset.
        To run predictions, the user must provide 13 numeric inputs.
    </p>

            <td>Distance in stellar radii</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Number of Transits</td>
            <td>None (count)</td>
            <td>Observed transit count</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No ML model is 100% accurate ‚Äî same here.</li>
        <li>We tested with multiple NASA datasets, but extra data added noise and overfitting.</li>
        <li>Final model uses only the KOI dataset for best balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thank you for trying out our work!
        We hope you enjoyed exploring this concept and our attempt to solve
        an astronomical challenge with machine learning. üåå

    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>
        The <b>Exoplanet Classifier </b> is a project developed by <b>Team Ontohin 4b</b> for the
        <b>NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this web app is to predict new exoplanet‚Äôs status
        (<b>CONFIRMED</b>, <b>CANDIDATE</b>, <b>FALSE POSITIVE</b>) by evaluating user-given inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        The user-given data is sent to the model via a Flask API endpoint.
        Then, the model predicts the classes and also returns a probability for each class
        (which you can see after hitting the ‚ÄúPredict‚Äù button).
    </p>

    <p>
        We have used the widely known <b>Scikit-learn</b> library and its
        <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> to build it from the ground up.
        It is an ensemble model which works by creating a bunch of decision trees
        and training them with slightly different features.
        If you want to learn more about it, click
        <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html"
            target="_blank">here</a>
        to see the official docs.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is one of the most widely used models provided by Scikit-learn and also very suitable for our objective.
        It predicts the result in three different classes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>CONFIRMED (2)</b> ‚Üí The disposition represents a confirmed exoplanet.</li>
        <li><b>CANDIDATE (1)</b> ‚Üí The disposition is neither a confirmed exoplanet nor a false positive. It requires
            further calculation to determine its actual status.</li>
        <li><b>FALSE POSITIVE (0)</b> ‚Üí The disposition does not represent an exoplanet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The model also returns a probability (up to 3 decimal digits) of its prediction for each of those 3 classes.
    </p>

    <h2>User Inputs</h2>
    <p>
        The model is trained on 14 different features (including the output column) sourced from
        NASA‚Äôs Kepler Object of Interest dataset. To run the prediction, the user needs to provide
        13 different values (all in real numbers) as input. Here is a list of them:

    <h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No ML model is perfectly accurate ‚Äî the same goes for this one.</li>
        <li>We tried to use more than just the KOI dataset. We tested with more data from other open-source datasets
            provided by NASA and its partners. Unfortunately, those introduced more noise and caused overfitting.</li>
        <li>Within the short time period, we could not come up with a better solution, so we continued with just one
            dataset.</li>
    </ul>
